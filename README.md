# SpinMC
This software package implements a Monte Carlo simulation for spin systems. It takes the Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters and the model type ('Ising', 'XY', or '3D') as input, producing the relaxed spin configurations across a specified temperature range and relevant average magnetic properties as output.
