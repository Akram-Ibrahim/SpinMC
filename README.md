# SpinMC
This software package implements a magnetic Monte Carlo simulation for spins in 2D materials. It takes the Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters and the model type ('Ising', 'XY', or '3D') as input, producing the relaxed spin configurations across a specified temperature range and relevant average magnetic properties as output.

The code can handle spins in 3D allowing to simulate generic spin spirals and skyrmions by including the Dzyaloshinskiiâ€“Moriya interaction (DMI) parameters along with the exhchange and anisotropy parameters.  

Currently the code conisders only first nereast neighbor interactions.
